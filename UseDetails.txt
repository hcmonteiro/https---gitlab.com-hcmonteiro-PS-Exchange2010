The Test-ExchangeServerHealth.ps1 PowerShell script will perform a series of tests against an Exchange Server 2010 or 2013 organization and produce a health report.

Tests include:

    General server health/uptime
    Status of Exchange services
    Transport queues and mail flow
    Mailbox database status
    Database Availability Group health 

The results are output to a HTML file or email that provides a summary and color-coded details of the results of each test.

For email reports make sure you modify the SMTP settings in the script:

 
PowerShell

#................................... 
# Modify these Email Settings 
#................................... 
 
$smtpsettings = @{ 
    To =  "administrator@exchangeserverpro.net" 
    From = "exchangeserver@exchangeserverpro.net" 
    Subject = "$reportemailsubject - $now" 
    SmtpServer = "smtp.exchangeserverpro.net" 
    }
